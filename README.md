# Summer-School-Resources
This repository has all the notebooks we were given during the 20 hours extensive learning experience given at : **Deep Learning: a hands-on introduction**: *Course organised within the Ph.D. Program in Computer Science and Systems Engineering Universit√† degli Studi di Genova* where I got accepted for the summer of 2021.

The course was designed such that even absolute beginners like me could grasp the concepts.
Hope it helps anyone venturing into Deep Learning :))
